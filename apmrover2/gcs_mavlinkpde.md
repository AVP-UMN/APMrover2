**MavLink** is a communication protocol for MAV (Micro Aerial Vehicles) that has nowadays been extended to all kind of drones (both aerial and terrestrial).

A **Ground Control station (GCS)** is a land- or sea-based control center that provides the facilities for human control of unmanned vehicles in the air or in space.When talking about a rover it can be as simple as a remote control device.

In this file the MavLink protocol is implemented and adapted to a rover.Remote control methods and sensors (rate control, attitude stabilization, yaw, altitud...) are enabled.
