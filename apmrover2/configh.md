# Config.h

###APM_Config.h

Before analizing the `Config.h`, it would be useful to comment the [APM_Config.h](https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/blob/master/APMrover2/APM_Config.h) file, which also stores configuration matters.

The `APM_Config.h` file is just a placeholder for your configuration file.  If you wish to change any of the setup parameters from their default values, place the appropriate `#define` statements here.

So the `APM_Config.h` funtion is to deal with your parameters and configuration choice.

On the other hand, `Config.h` contains default and automatic configuration details. As you will see there are many warnings alont the file to avoid changes that can lead to desconfiguration.
